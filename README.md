A simple code to visualize data using diffrenet ploting methods.

*NOTE : * You need to cmplete the main_block before using any ploting method other than scatter plot. (I was too lazy to complete it xd)

Here's a demo of each ploting method : 

<h2>Scatter plot with colour groupings</h2>

<h2>Scatter plot with colour groupings and size encoding for the third variable of country size</h2>
